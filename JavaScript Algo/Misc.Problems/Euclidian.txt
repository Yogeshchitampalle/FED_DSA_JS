# Let's take an example and walk through the steps of the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers.

Example:
Let's find the GCD of 48 and 18 using the Euclidean algorithm.

Step 1:
Divide 48 by 18 to find the remainder:
48 รท 18 = 2 remainder 12 
# Let's Understand 
To find the remainder when dividing 48 by 18, we perform the following calculation:

48 รท 18 = 2 remainder 12

Here's how it works:

We start by dividing 48 by 18.
The quotient is the largest whole number that can be obtained by dividing 48 by 18 without going over. In this case, it is 2.
The remainder is the remaining value after subtracting the product of the quotient and the divisor from the dividend. In this case, it is 12.
The remainder represents the portion of the dividend that could not be divided evenly by the divisor.
To verify the result, we can multiply the quotient by the divisor and add the remainder:

2 * 18 + 12 = 48

So, when we divide 48 by 18, the quotient is 2 and the remainder is 12.

Step 2:
Since the remainder is not 0, we update the values:
a = 18 (the divisor)
b = 12 (the remainder)

Step 3:
Divide 18 by 12 to find the remainder:
18 รท 12 = 1 remainder 6

Step 4:
Update the values again:
a = 12
b = 6

Step 5:
Divide 12 by 6 to find the remainder:
12 รท 6 = 2 remainder 0

Step 6:
Since the remainder is now 0, we stop the algorithm.
The GCD is the value of b, which is 6.

Therefore, the GCD of 48 and 18 is 6.

In each step of the Euclidean algorithm, we divide the larger number (a) by the smaller number (b) and compute the remainder. Then, we update the values of a and b by setting a = b and b = remainder. We repeat these steps until the remainder becomes 0. The GCD is the value of the last non-zero remainder.

The Euclidean algorithm simplifies the process of finding the GCD by reducing the problem to smaller and smaller remainders until a remainder of 0 is reached.
